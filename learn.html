<p>Learning the ukulele is a fantastic hobby and an excellent introduction to the world of music. It's easy to pick up, fun to play, and a great way to develop musical skills. 
Joining a group like the Sou'West Strummers or another ukulele club gives you the opportunity to practice for two hours in a supportive and enjoyable environment. 
You'll not only improve your playing but also receive valuable advice from experienced musicians. Plus, being part of a club helps you stay motivated, meet new people, 
and enjoy the social side of making music together.
<p>Check out the <i class="fa fa-music"></i> <a href="songs.html">Songs</a> for inspiration, you can also use "learn" in the search bar for songs that contain only the easy cords (C, C7, G, F, A, Am)
